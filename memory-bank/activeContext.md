# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
**Memory Bank Initialization** - Setting up comprehensive project documentation to enable effective work continuity across sessions. The project is in its initial setup phase, ready for Gatsby project scaffolding.

## Immediate Context
- Fresh React assignment project (react-assignment-06-2005)
- Empty repository with only cursor rules configured
- On task-1-cursor branch for development work
- Memory Bank core files being created

## Recent Changes
1. **Repository Analysis**: Explored project structure and found empty repo with cursor rules
2. **Memory Bank Creation**: 
   - Created `memory-bank/` directory
   - Documented project brief and core requirements
   - Established product context and user goals
   - Defined technical constraints and architecture patterns
   - Outlined system design patterns

## Current Status
- ‚úÖ Project exploration completed
- ‚úÖ Memory Bank directory created
- ‚úÖ Core documentation files created:
  - `projectbrief.md` - Foundation document with requirements
  - `productContext.md` - Purpose and user experience goals
  - `techContext.md` - Technology stack and constraints
  - `systemPatterns.md` - Architecture and design patterns
- üîÑ **In Progress**: `activeContext.md` (this file)
- ‚è≥ **Next**: `progress.md` - Current status tracking

## Next Immediate Steps
1. **Complete Memory Bank**: Finish creating `progress.md` file
2. **Project Setup**: Initialize Gatsby project with TypeScript and Tailwind
3. **Dependencies**: Install and configure required packages
4. **Basic Structure**: Set up initial project structure following defined patterns

## Active Decisions
- **Technology Stack Confirmed**: TypeScript + Gatsby + React + Tailwind CSS
- **Architecture Pattern**: Functional components with hooks, strict TypeScript
- **File Organization**: Component-based structure with clear separation of concerns
- **Styling Approach**: Tailwind utility-first with mobile-first responsive design

## Key Considerations
- Project must demonstrate modern React best practices
- Code quality and type safety are primary concerns
- Performance optimization through Gatsby's static generation
- Clean, maintainable code structure for evaluation purposes

## Blockers/Questions
- None currently identified
- Project requirements are clear from assignment context
- Technical stack is well-defined and documented

## Work Environment
- **OS**: macOS (darwin 24.5.0)
- **Shell**: Zsh
- **Editor**: Cursor with AI assistance
- **Branch**: task-1-cursor (active development)
- **Directory**: `/Volumes/MAC_DOCS/repos/AI-Innowise/react-assignment-06-2005`

## Documentation Status
- Memory Bank initialization: 80% complete
- Ready to proceed with project setup once Memory Bank is finalized
- All core architectural decisions documented and ready for implementation
